pitch: The primary goal of the "OWASP Top 10 Low-Code/No-Code Security Risks" document is to provide assistance and education for organizations looking to adopt and develop Low-Code/No-Code applications. The guide provides information about what are the most prominent security risks for such applications, the challenges involved, and how to overcome them.

## Overview
Low-code/No-Code development platforms provides a development environment used to create application software through a graphical user interface instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming. 
Such platforms reduce the amount of traditional hand coding, enabling accelerated delivery of business applications. 

As Low-Code/No-Code platforms proliferate and become widely used by organizations, there is a clear and immediate need to create awareness around security and privacy risks related to applications developed on such platforms.
