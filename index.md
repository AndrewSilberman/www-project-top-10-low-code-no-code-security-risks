## Overview
Low-code development platforms provides a development environment used to create application software through a graphical user interface instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming. Low-code development platforms reduce the amount of traditional hand coding, enabling accelerated delivery of business applications. 

As Low-Code platforms proliferate and become widely used by organizations, there is a clear and immediate need to create awareness around security and privacy risks related to applications developed on such platforms.
