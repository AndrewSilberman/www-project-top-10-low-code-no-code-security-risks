Got any ideas on how to make this project better? These guidelines could help make things clearer going forward.
1. Join the conversation on [email](https://groups.google.com/g/owasp-no-code-low-code) or [Slack](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C02C6RU6G10) to find collaborators or see if others have a similar interest (see Join tab)
2. Search the project's [GitHub issues](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-low-code-no-code-security-risks/issues) for related proposals. Found one? Join it!
3. If you haven't found a relevant issue, create one! Clearly specify why your proposal is important and which changes are proposed. Advertise your proposal to others to find collaborators. See examples: [Add descriptions for business users](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-low-code-no-code-security-risks/issues/48), [Add product-specific examples](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-low-code-no-code-security-risks/issues/49).
4. Create an initial draft implementing your proposal and submit it for review as a PR. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
5. Advertise your proposal to others and ask for reviews.
5. Once your PR is merged, continue to submit PRs to fine-tune and improve on previous versions.
6. Congrats and thank you!
