## The Gist

## Description

Low-code/no-code applications heavily rely on ready-made components out of the marketplace or the web, including data connectors, widgets and sub-services. 
In many cases, entire applications are built by vendors. 
Third-party components and applications are often a target for attackers who wish to compromise a large number of customers.

Unmanaged Custom Code

Low-code/no-code applications often enable extendability through custom code. 
These pieces of code are embedded into the application, and in some cases are not held up to the same level of security vigilance as with other pro-code applications. 

## Impact
