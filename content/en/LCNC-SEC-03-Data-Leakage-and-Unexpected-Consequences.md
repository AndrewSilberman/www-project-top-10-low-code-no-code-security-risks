# LCNC-SEC-03: Data Leakage and Unexpected Consequences

## Risk Rating [*](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/Note_About_Risks)

| Prevalence | Detectability | Exploitability | Technical Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |

## Description

Low-code/no-code applications often sync data or trigger operations across multiple systems. 
This means that data easily find its way outside the organizational boundary and operations in one system can have unexpected consequences in another. 
This problem becomes even more difficult since apps can be chain one after the other.

## Impact

TBD

## How to Prevent

TBD

## Example Attack Scenarios

Email forwarding
Shadow vendors - data moving outside the org boundary
Several hidden automations chain together two seemingly unrelated systems

### Scenario #1
