## The Gist

## Description

No-code/low-code applications can ingest user-controlled data in multiple ways, including direct input, triggering or retrieving user-generated content. 
Since apps are often query a database based on user content, the risk of injection-based attacks is big.

## Impact

TBD

## How to Prevent

TBD

## Example Attack Scenarios

Improper input sanitation. Automations connecting various user inputs right into DBs. Very similar to the injection risk for Serverless Security.

### Scenario #1
