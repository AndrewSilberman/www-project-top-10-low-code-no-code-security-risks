## The Gist

No-code/low-code applications ingest user-generated data in multiple ways, including direct input or retrieving user-generated content from various services.

## Description

No-code/low-code applications ingest user-generated data in multiple ways, including direct input or retrieving user-generated content from various services.
Since applications often query data dynamically based on user input, they are exposed to a significant risk of injection-based attacks.
Moreover, since applications can use user-generated content in various ways including querying a database, parsing a document and more, protection from injection-based attacks must take into account the specific applications and its use of user data. 

## Impact

TBD

## Example Attack Scenarios

Ideas to explore (TBD):
- Improper input sanitation. Automations connecting various user inputs right into DBs. Very similar to the injection risk for Serverless Security.

### Scenario #1

TBD

### Scenario #2

TBD

## How to Prevent

- Sanitize user input, taking into the account the operations that will be performed on that input by the application.
- Educate business users on the risk of unsanitized user input. Platform cannot make this problem go away on their own.
