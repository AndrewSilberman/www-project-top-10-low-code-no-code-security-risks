# LCNC-SEC-10: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

## Risk Rating [*](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/Note_About_Risks)

## The Gist

No-code/low-code applications often lack a comprehensive audit trail, produce none or insufficient logs, and fail to clear logs from sensitive data.

## Description

No-code/low-code applications often rely on vendors to generate logs and monitors.
In many cases, logs are either insufficient or not being collected, impeding security investigations and failing to satisfy compliance requirements.
Applications often lack a comprehensive audit trail, preventing change management processes and inquires.

Furthermore, many native log streams mix between application logs, metrics and sensitive data being passed through the application.
On many platforms and by default, logs will contain actual data points used by the application.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

App logs are turned-off.
When a breach attempt occurs, security teams are unable to determine who access the app and what did they try to do. 

### Scenario #2

A maker creates an app that allow users to search through their corporate drive for certain files.
The app logs full execution context, including the file's content.
The maker can view app logs, giving them access to user files.

## How to Prevent

- Leverage platform built-in capabilities to collect user access and platform audit logs.
- When applicable, instrument applications with logging mechanisms to provide extra visibility.
- Ensure logs are not contaminated with sensitive data by configuring the platform not to log raw application data.
