## Description

Low-code/no-code applications heavily rely on ready-made components out of the marketplace or the web, including data connectors, widgets and sub-services. 
In many cases, entire applications are built by vendors. 
Third-party components and applications are often a target for attackers who wish to compromise a large number of customers.
