## Risk Rating [*](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/Note_About_Risks)

| Prevalence | Detectability | Exploitability | Technical Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |

## Description

Low-code/no-code applications can store data as part of their "code" or in managed databases offered by the platform. 
In many cases, sensitive data is stored unencrypted, data is moved between geolocations without regulatory requirements in mind and secrets are hard-coded as plaintext.

## Impact

TBD

## How to Prevent

TBD

## Example Attack Scenarios

Sensitive data stored unencrypted (e.g. credit card)
Data moved between GEOs in a non-compliant way

### Scenario #1

### Scenario #2
